				Until 2013, Elon Musk's children all attended the exclusive Mirman school of excellence for gifted children based in Los Angeles, but Musk was disappointed and frustrated by the structure and teachings of the school, although it is not known why, to be honest, he never disclosed the details.
				In 2014 he decided to found his own version of the school together with Joshua Daun, a teacher among the managers of the Mirman school and other teachers of the highest level who shared his pedagogical ideas.
				Initially the school was reserved exclusively for Elon's children and was organized inside a SpaceX conference room, then it gradually expanded to children of relevant figures of Musk's companies and now hosts about 40 boys and girls between 8 and 14 years, and there is also a rather obscure and incomprehensible where it seems that your child can apply, with online questions about the colonization of planets and problems on which the boy must express himself.
				The selection process, as well as the parameters used, is completely mysterious and arbitrary, we read around employees of SpaceX who can't even get information about the school, despite the fact that in their contract with the company, Ad Astra was mentioned.
