                Elon Musk is a business magnate, well known because of his technology and engineering projects. He founded many companies, such as The Boring Company (that builds underground transportation systems), Tesla, Neuralink and many others. Some months ago, he also bought Twitter for $44 billion.
                He is a very criticized person, because he has made controversial statements on politics and technology, and he also has made unscientific and misleading statements.
                Musk was born in South Africa, and he later moved to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania. After completing his studies, he started some of his projects. His major projects are PayPal (sold to eBay), Zip2 (which provided online city guide services, sold to Compaq), SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink. He is also involved in other activities, such as HyperLoop and OpenAI.
                Musk's success in these projects has made him one of the wealthiest people in the world.
