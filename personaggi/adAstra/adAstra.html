		<p>Elon Musk is a business magnate, well known because of his technology
			and engineering projects. He founded many companies, such as The Boring
			Company (that builds underground transportation systems), Tesla,
			Neuralink and many others. Some months ago, he also bought Twitter for
			$44 billion. He is a very criticized person, because he has made
			controversial statements on politics and technology, and he also has
			made unscientific and misleading statements. Musk was born in South
			Africa, and he later moved to the United States to attend the University
			of Pennsylvania. After completing his studies, he started some of his
			projects. His major projects are PayPal (sold to eBay), Zip2 (which
			provided online city guide services, sold to Compaq), SpaceX, Tesla,
			Neuralink. He is also involved in other activities, such as HyperLoop
			and OpenAI. Musk's success in these projects has made him one of the
			wealthiest people in the world.
		</p>
		<p>Until 2013, Elon Musk's children all attended the exclusive Mirman
			school of excellence for gifted children based in Los Angeles, but Musk
			was disappointed and frustrated by the structure and teachings of the
			school, although it is not known why, to be honest, he never disclosed
			the details. In 2014 he decided to found his own version of the school
			together with Joshua Daun, a teacher among the managers of the Mirman
			school and other teachers of the highest level who shared his
			pedagogical ideas. Initially the school was reserved exclusively for
			Elon's children and was organized inside a SpaceX conference room, then
			it gradually expanded to children of relevant figures of Musk's
			companies and now hosts about 40 boys and girls between 8 and 14 years,
			and there is also a rather obscure and incomprehensible where it seems
			that your child can apply, with online questions about the colonization
			of planets and problems on which the boy must express himself. The
			selection process, as well as the parameters used, is completely
			mysterious and arbitrary, we read around employees of SpaceX who can't
			even get information about the school, despite the fact that in their
			contract with the company, Ad Astra was mentioned.
		</p>
		<p>What Makes Elon Musk's School Different Everything else is teaching
			practice. He develops students fascinated by complexity and solving the
			unknown. It is annually based on student's learning path. It applies
			lessons learned new programs from every project, workshop and
			conversation next step. Often the school system is strict and more
			suitable for the system compares students. Usually, the school system is
			rigid and more focussed on system than on the student. Ad Astra is
			changing that status quo by creating a student-centered philosophy,
			which value personal skills, praise curiosity, encourage problem solving
			and critical thinking. Curiosity is one of the most important human
			qualities. Elon Musk uses this quality to encourage independent and
			inquiry-based learning, harnessing students' natural curiosity to
			realign their relationship to the unknown and unlock their limitless
			potential.

		<p>Presents Ad Astra Site in which you can find information for the school
			starting from how they work, their conundrums, how to work in ad Astra
			and what skills you need to have to teach in Elon Musk's School.They
			don’t have classes like normal schools, as they only work in online
			schools. Furthermore, they created two types of enrollment: full time
			and part-time, so you can choose for yourself and the life of your
			children how many times they could attend different classes.They work
			with students with 10-14 years who are internationally qualified, and
			the class size is from 6 to 16 students. Their key point is to teach the
			art of problem-solving, in order to solve their daily problems as
			engineers.They aspire to bring better educational experiences to all
			students through collaborations with other organizations.

		<p>It does not have a social profile, and above all, it does not
			differentiate between school grades, as first graders are in the same
			class as third graders."You need to advance kids to the same grade in
			the same time, like an assembly line." This is one of the things he said
			in an interview in which he reveals the purpose of this exclusive
			school, which today has 31 pupils, including his 5 children. As a child,
			Elon hated school, hated it so much that he was terrified of going to
			it. In an interview, he says that when he was at his school in Pretoria,
			South Africa, he was bullied several times. His comrades had pushed him
			down the stairwell and in another case he was beaten up to hospital. To
			date, Astra has only three teachers who aim to satisfy the abilities of
			each individual student and not to make them follow an arbitration
			program, but in a constructive way and thus developing problem solving.
